-- Could NOT find kdl_parser (missing: kdl_parser_DIR)
-- Could not find the required component 'kdl_parser'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "kdl_parser" with
  any of the following names:

    kdl_parserConfig.cmake
    kdl_parser-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "kdl_parser" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "kdl_parser_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "kdl_parser" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
